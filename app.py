    Hey Guys!!!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Welcome to my Website üôåüéÜüòé. \n 
    This website is used to predict the priceüí≤of used cars üöó based on 5 specific features of the car.\n
    This website estimates the priceüí≤ of any carüöô based on Machine Learning Approach. In the Machine Learning approach, we provide the Machine
    learning algorithm with some data. Then the algorithm creates a Machine Learning model which estimates the selling price of used cars
    based on 5 specific features of the car. The input to the machine learning model would be given by the end user or the 
    client.\n
    The data is collected from kaggle, which was collected by a kaggle user from \'Car Dekho.com\' .\n
    \'CarDekho.com\' is India's leading car search venture that helps users buy cars that are right for them. It's website and app carry rich automotive
    content such as expert reviews, detailed specs & prices, comparisions as well as videos & pictures of all car brands & models available in india.\n
    In the \'Home page\', you would get a brief description about \'CarDekho.com\' and my project. In the \'EDA page\', you would be able to see graphical
    representation of my project data. In the \'Predict Price\' page, you would be able to estimate price of the used car based on 5 specific features of the car.
